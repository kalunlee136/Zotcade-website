		<h3 id="htmlStructure"><strong>A) HTML Structure</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<h5>
			In order the Flipping Cards to take effect you need to add the folders css and js where your html file is:
		</h5>
		<img src="assets/images/ss01.png" alt="HTML Structure" />

		<h5>And this peace of code at the beggining of you html:</h5>
		<img src="assets/images/ss0.png" alt="HTML Structure" />

		<br><br>

		<h5>Easy html markup for creating a Flipping Card: <br></h5>
		<p>

			Each card needs to be nested within a section tag with a class of "card-container". Inside the section tag all needs to be nested within a div with a class of "card", and here is where we can change the behavior of the Flipping Card. Inside there are 2 divs, one with a class of "Front" for the Front side of the card, and the other with a class of "back" for the Back side of the card.<br>

			<h5>We have 4 options to trigger the effect:</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>When we move the mouse over the card</strong>, just add a class of "over" to the div with a class of "card" like in the example that follows. <br>
					<img src="assets/images/ss1.png" alt="HTML Structure" />
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>When we move click the card</strong>, just add a class of "click" to the div with a class of "card" like in the example that follows. <br>
					<img src="assets/images/ss2.png" alt="HTML Structure" />
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>When we want a button inside the card to activate the effect</strong>, don't add a class to the div with a class of "card" like before, instead add a class of "cbutton" to the element that you want the effect to be activated by, in the example that follows is activated by a button (input type="button"). <br>
					<img src="assets/images/ss3.png" alt="HTML Structure" />
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>When we want a card to flip automatically</strong>, also don't add any extra class like over or click just leave it with "card" like before, and now you can use 2 attributes to specify the auto flip. First the "data-autoflip" parameter that will be the time that you wish the card to wait until its next auto flip, and the second parameter "data-start" that will be the time that you whish the card to wait until its <strong>first</strong> flip after the page load.
					<img src="assets/images/ss8.png" alt="">
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<h5>You can also change the direction of the Flipping Card (you have 4 options): </h5>
		<p>All you need is to change the data-direction tag of the div with a class of "card"</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>right</strong> <br>
				<img src="assets/images/ss4.png" alt="HTML Structure" />
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>left</strong> <br>
				<img src="assets/images/ss5.png" alt="HTML Structure" />
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>top</strong> <br>
				<img src="assets/images/ss6.png" alt="HTML Structure" />
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>bottom</strong> <br>
				<img src="assets/images/ss7.png" alt="HTML Structure" />
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h5>There are already few defaults colors available for your flipping card and you can just add the class of the color to the div with a class of "card-container". These are the colors available:</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>purple</li>
			<li>red</li>
			<li>blue</li>
			<li>light-blue</li>
			<li>green</li>
			<li>orange</li>
			<li>yellow</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			For example if you wish to add the blue color just add it like this:
			<img src="assets/images/ss9.png" alt="">
		</p>
	
		<p>
			If you wish to create your own color you can go ahead and take a look at the end of the flipCard.css file to the ones that are already there and copy the pattern that goes like this (e.g. for a black color):
		</p>

		<pre>
	/* BLACK */
	.black div.card{
		color: white;
		border: 1px solid black;
	}

	.black div.card div{
		background: black; 
	}
		</pre>

		<p>
			And then just add it there to the flipCard.css file.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you would like to edit the background color, color, font, or style of the Flipping Cards, you would do the following:
		</p>

<pre>	.card-container .card div{
	    background: #FBFBFB;
	    border: 1px solid #BFBFBF;
	}
</pre>
		<p>
			If you want to be more especific and edit just one side you would do the following for the front side:
		</p>

<pre>	.card-container .card div.front{
	    background: #FBFBFB;
	    border: 1px solid #BFBFBF;
	}
</pre>
		<p>
			and you would do the following for the back side:
		</p>
<pre>	.card-container .card div.back{
	    background: #FBFBFB;
	    border: 1px solid #BFBFBF;
	}
</pre>

		<p>
			If you want to edit the velocity of the Flipping Card you would do the following (just change the .7s to the velocity in seconds that you wish):
		</p>
<pre>	.card-container .card {
		-webkit-transition: -webkit-transform .7s;
		 -moz-transition: -moz-transform .7s;
		   -o-transition: -o-transform .7s;
		  -ms-transition: -o-transform .7s;
		      transition: transform .7s;
	  }
</pre>	

		<p>So, to ensure that your new styles are applied, make sure that they carry enough "weight" and that there isn't a style lower in the CSS file that is being applied after yours.</p>

		<h3 id="cssFiles"><strong>B) CSS Files and Structure</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>I'm using two CSS files in this plugin. The first one is just some random style for the demo, and it is NOT needed. </p> 

		<p>The second one contains all the CSS3 3D effects and style for the Flipping Cards. The file is separated into sections using:</p>  

<pre>	/* === CARD CONTAINER === */

	some code

	/* === CARD === */
	
	some code
	
	/* === STYLE FOR THE FRONT & BACK SIDE === */
	
	some code
	
	/* === BEGGINING EFFECT === */
	
	some code
	
	/* === EFFECT DIRECTIONS === */
	
	some code
</pre>
		
		<p>If you would like to edit a specific section of the site, simply find the appropriate label in the CSS file, and then scroll down until you find the appropriate style that needs to be edited.</p>

		<h3 id="javascript"><strong>C) JavaScript</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>This plugin imports two Javascript files.</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>jQuery</li>
			<li>My custom scripts</li>
		</ol>
		  
		<ol>
			<li>jQuery is a Javascript library that greatly reduces the amount of code that you must write.</li>
			<li>Most of the animation in this site is carried out from the customs scripts. 
			</li>
